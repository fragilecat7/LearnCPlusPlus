## Chapter 2

Rubber hits the road, or it should do and lets confirm it here. I choose to use Clion as my IDE as I have used JetBrian's products and rather like them.

Notes

- Hello main()!
- What is this header std_lib_facilities.h?
- Stopped really using the header, things are working, my understanding is not deep :)
- Figure will use the namespace operator std:: for practise
- 2.4 Linking, always good to learn more about this step, read again.
- Began organizing project due to clutter in main.cpp
- Initial chapter setup of chapter questions my non-answers and terms related to the chapter
