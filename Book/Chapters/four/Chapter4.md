## Chapter 4

I like the way the chapter is organized, expression, selection and iteration then the first discussion of a `function` and we say hello to the `vector` type!

- expression, how to compute a value from a set of operands.
- selection, how to choose among alternative actions.
- iteration, repeat a computation for a series of values.
