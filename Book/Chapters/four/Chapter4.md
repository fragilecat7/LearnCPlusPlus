## Chapter 4

I like the way the chapter is organized, expression, selection and iteration then the first discussion of a `function` and we say hello to the `vector` type!

- `expressions`, how to compute a value from a set of operands.
    - basic building block
    - literals == constants
    - Constant expressions
    - expression statement, an expression followed by a semicolon
- `selection`, how to choose among alternative actions.
    - if statement
    - switch statement

- `iteration`, repeat a computation for a series of values.

4.6.3 - ```...we use the input operation std::cin>>temp, s the condition for a for-statement. Basically , std::cin>>temp is true if a value was read correctly and fasle otherwise```
