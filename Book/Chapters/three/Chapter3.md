## Chapter 3

Let's read that title again, ```Objects, Types and Values``` For me this has always been about the nuts and bolts of any language and a through understanding has always beneficial to the programmer, me. And yes that is an on going effort. Very much struck by the powerful simpilicity of the  list of statements in section 3.8 that I am going to repeat it here.

- A 'type' defines a set of possible values and a set of operations (for an object) 
- A 'object' is some memory that holds a value of a given 'type'
- A 'value' is a set of bits in memory interpreted according to a 'type'
- A 'variable' is a named `object`
- A 'declaration' is a statement that givens a name to an 'object'
- A 'definition' is a 'declaration' that sets aside memory for an 'object'

My thoughts here, are that I should read that daily for a while...

`Type safety` - from the book: ```...is type-safe when objects are used only according to the rules for their type.``` Bit dry but I do not think it wise to compact it any more.

`Type Conversions`, two types, ah. Safe and Unsafe.  Explain narrowing?

Hello `operators` and `variables`, we will be doing more fun stuff presently with you guys!

### Notes
- Directory structure reordered to reflect book structure
- Using classes to represent chapters
- Base class for `Chapter`, playing with fire, but it is keeping me warm! 
- Added `Book` header to help organize project better (headers: learn more)
- added `README` 
- Very useful to play with `std::cin` and `std::cout`, better conceptual model, see $ amount output for piggybank coin counter
